# 🌍 Transparent Donation Platform with Real-Time Audits

Welcome to the next-gen donation platform where every contribution is **verifiable, traceable, and impactful**. Built on the Stacks blockchain, this system ensures donors can trust that their funds are used as promised — with **live impact metrics** (like lives saved, meals provided, or water wells built).

2. Once approved, create a donation campaign
3. Receive donations transparently
4. Post periodic **impact updates** (tracked by the audit system)
